    "A chessboard is used for camera calibration since its regular patterns of high contrast make it easy to detect automatically. So, if we use our camera to take multiple pictures of chessboard agaisnt a flat surface, then we will be able to detect any distortion by looking at the difference between the appartent size and shape of the squares of the chessboard pattern.\n",

    "* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.\n",

    "* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.\n",
    "* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image (\"birds-eye view\").\n",
    "* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.\n",
    "* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.\n",
    "* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.\n",
    "* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position."

We should get a output that looks as shown below.\n",
